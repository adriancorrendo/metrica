\title{Modified Index of Agreement (d1).}
\usage{
d1(data = NULL, obs, pred, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(Optional) argument to call an existing data frame containing the data.}

\item{obs}{Vector with observed values (numeric).}

\item{pred}{Vector with predicted values (numeric).}

\item{na.rm}{Logic argument to remove rows with missing values
(NA). Default is na.rm = TRUE.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{numeric}.
}
\description{
It estimates the modified index of agreement (d1).
}
\details{
Similar to d, the d1 index it is a normalized, dimensionless metric that tests general agreement.
The difference with d, is that d1 uses absolute residuals instead of squared residuals. It is bounded between 0 and 1.
The disadvantage is that d is an asymmetric index, that is, dependent to the orientation of
predicted and observed values.
