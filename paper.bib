   abstract = {Performance metrics in classification are fundamental in assessing the quality of learning methods and learned models. However, many different measures have been defined in the literature with the aim of making better choices in general or for a specific application area. Choices made by one metric are claimed to be different from choices made by other metrics. In this work, we analyse experimentally the behaviour of 18 different performance metrics in several scenarios, identifying clusters and relationships between measures. We also perform a sensitivity analysis for all of them in terms of several traits: class threshold choice, separability/ranking quality, calibration performance and sensitivity to changes in prior class distribution. From the definitions and experiments, we make a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between metrics, and a taxonomy and arrangement of them according to the previous traits. This can be useful for choosing the most adequate measure (or set of measures) for a specific application. Additionally, the study also highlights some niches in which new measures might be defined and also shows that some supposedly innovative measures make the same choices (or almost) as existing ones. Finally, this work can also be used as a reference for comparing experimental results in pattern recognition and machine learning literature, when using different measures.},

@article{david2007,
   abstract = {The proportion of successful hits, usually referred to as "accuracy", is by far the most dominant meter for measuring classifiers' accuracy. This is despite of the fact that accuracy does not compensate for hits that can be attributed to mere chance. Is it a meaningful flaw in the context of machine learning? Are we using the wrong meter for decades? The results of this study do suggest that the answers to these questions are positive. Cohen's kappa, a meter that does compensate for random hits, was compared with accuracy, using a benchmark of fifteen datasets and five well-known classifiers. It turned out that the average probability of a hit being the result of mere chance exceeded one third (!). It was also found that the proportion of random hits varied with different classifiers that were applied even to a single dataset. Consequently, the rankings of classifiers' accuracy, with and without compensation for random hits, differed from each other in eight out of the fifteen datasets. Therefore, accuracy may well fail in its main task, namely to properly measure the accuracy-wise merits of the classifiers themselves. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
